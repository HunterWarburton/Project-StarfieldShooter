Starfield Shooter is a practice project made in javascript. It is meant to be an in-browser playable game reminescent of Galaga, 1942, and other shmup or bullet-hell games.

##Features/Learning Purposes
Starfield Shooter began as a simple attempt to create parallax scrolling with dots moving down the screen at different speeds. The result of that can still be seen in the background of this game.
The game has expanded as practice with javascript coding.
The player controls a ship with the mouse and can press the spacebar to activate a superweapon (*only partially implemented*)
Hitting an enemy with a projectile with earn a point, while an enemy hitting the player with their projectiles deducts a point from the score.
Collect powerups to change weapons.
